Our ecommerce project, led by Ephraim Matarutse, is dedicated to selling cellphones and accessories online. We have implemented a Stripe checkout system for seamless and secure transactions. Our goal is to provide customers with a smooth and convenient shopping experience. The project team c Ephraim. When approaching this engineering challenge, our primary focus was on two key aspects: creating a user-friendly interface that works well on both web and mobile platforms, and integrating a reliable and advanced API. As l focused his efforts on backend and frontend.

In our ecommerce venture, led by Ephraim Matarutse, we established an online store specializing in selling cellphones and accessories. With a streamlined Stripe checkout, our primary objectives were to provide a user-friendly web and mobile experience and integrate a robust API. My project focused on developing a seamless digital platform catering to the needs of customers seeking the least elevated biking routes in San Francisco. By combining our expertise, we successfully created an ecommerce store that offers a convenient and reliable shopping experience for cellphone and accessory enthusiasts.

In my project for WholeLight Trading, I have developed a full-stack ecommerce application using Django and React. Our team, including myself, focused on creating a seamless and user-friendly web and mobile experience for customers. Through the integration of Django on the backend and React on the frontend, we successfully built a robust platform that allows users to browse and purchase products. Our emphasis was on developing a scalable and efficient application while implementing essential features like inventory management, user authentication, and product listing. This ecommerce app serves as a comprehensive solution for WholeLight Trading, providing a smooth shopping experience to their customers.


In an ecommerce app, it is crucial to provide users with live updates on product availability, stock levels, and other relevant information. Achieving real-time updates required establishing a bidirectional communication channel between the Django backend and the React frontend. This involved researching and integrating technologies such as WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE) to enable efficient data exchange.

The challenge was not just in setting up the communication channels but also ensuring that the updates were processed accurately and quickly. I had to consider factors like handling multiple concurrent connections, managing event-driven server architecture, and optimizing performance to prevent latency issues.

To address this challenge, I architectured a solution that utilized Django Channels, an extension of Django that added WebSocket support. This allowed for asynchronous communication and event-driven handling of updates. On the frontend, I incorporated libraries like Socket.io or WebSocket APIs to establish the connection and manage the real-time updates.

Testing and debugging were crucial in the process, as it required identifying any synchronization issues or potential race conditions. Rigorous testing and stress testing scenarios were conducted to ensure the system functioned correctly and maintained data integrity across the application.

By overcoming this technical challenge, we successfully implemented real-time updates and synchronization in the ecommerce app for WholeLight Trading. It greatly enhanced the user experience, providing customers with immediate and accurate information on product availability, stock updates, and other dynamic aspects of the application.

This experience not only allowed me to strengthen my expertise in working with Django and React but also emphasized the importance of addressing real-time updates efficiently in ecommerce applications. It highlighted the significance of planning, thorough research, effective integration of technologies, and rigorous testing to overcome complex technical obstacles.


Through the process of creating a full-stack ecommerce website for selling accessories and phones, I have gained valuable insights and knowledge. I have learned to effectively integrate technologies, such as Django on the backend and React on the frontend, to build a robust and scalable application. Additionally, I have developed proficiency in implementing core features like inventory management, user authentication, and product listing. The project has also taught me the importance of creating a seamless and user-friendly web and mobile experience. Overall, I have acquired a deep understanding of the complexities involved in developing and deploying a successful ecommerce website.


I am a highly skilled full-stack developer based in Harare with 3 years experience, with expertise in Python using Django for backend development and JavaScript with React, Node.js, and Next.js for frontend development. With my comprehensive knowledge of these languages and frameworks, I have the ability to create robust and scalable web applications. I excel in designing intuitive user experiences, implementing efficient server-side logic, and integrating seamless client-side functionalities. My passion for coding, attention to detail, and dedication to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends allow me to deliver high-quality solutions that meet and exceed client expectations.
